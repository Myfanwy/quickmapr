Description: Many packages exist or are in development that faciliate
    visualizing spatial data in R; however, most of these pacakges are geared
    toward interactive visualization, for production quality maps, or do not
    directly map \code{sp} or \code{raster} objects. This package fills in that
    gap and is geared towards a typical GIS-type workflow that required quickly
    visualizing results relative to other spatial data and allows for a basic
    level of interactivity that includes zooming in, zooming out, panning, and
    labelling.
Imports:
    rgdal,
    raster,
    sp,
    mapproj,
    ggplot2
