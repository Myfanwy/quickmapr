quickmapr
=========

there are many packages that already exist or are in active development that support the visualization of
spatial data in r.  however, there seems to be a gap for those that need to quickly view, compare, and
explore the results of a given spatial analysis. i hope this package will fill that void.  

the current thinking for `quickmapr` is to allow for quick visualization of `sp` and `raster` objects. 
planned functiinality for the first release is for easy adding and removing of layers, simple zooming, 
panning, and labelling.  these tools are intended for use within an active spatial analysis workflow and not for production quality maps.
